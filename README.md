# wordle-game
My First Project! A Wordle-like-game built using Python and Pygame.
# Wordle Game ðŸŽ®  
I created it with the help of tutorials and guidance while learning programming concepts.  

## What I Learned
- How to use Pygame for creating interactive games.
- Understanding event handling and rendering graphics.
- Basics of game logic and structuring a project.

## Acknowledgements

Iâ€™m excited to continue learning and building more projects!!
